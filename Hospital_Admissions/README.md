# Hospital Admissions
Predicting and preventing unplanned hospital
admissions (UHAs) is a valuable task both to
improve patient health and prevent overuse of
emergency department resources. While traditional
UHA models make use of structured
health data including diagnosis and procedure
codes and demographic factors, there is untapped
potential to improve our models by making
use of the unstructured clinical notes provided
by healthcare professionals. Here, we
demonstrate the utility of these notes by using
natural language processing to classify UHAs
from clinical text.
